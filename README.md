# TDD

## Getting started

This project was begun with the following command:

```txt
npx create-react-app tdd-react --template typescript
```

It uses the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for testing.  It was installed like this:

```txt
npm install â€“save-dev @testing-library/react
```

### Original Readme

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

** When creating this app, I didn't know that the default package manager was yarn.  Using npm then created two lock files, which is not good.  SO I deleted the yarn lock and so this branch should continue to use npm.  Probably we should use yarn in the next project since that is the default.
